A complete chess with react
=======================

This is a complete implementation of chess with react and redux. It supports everything necessary to play against another human on the same computer, including special rules like castling or en-passant and most importantly end-of-game detection.
`master` is always deployed [here](https://flo-l.github.io/react-chess).
