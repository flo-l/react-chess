A complete chess with react
=======================

![Screenshot](/../screenshots/screenshot1.png?raw=true "Screenshot")

This is a complete implementation of chess with react and redux.

It supports everything necessary to play against another human on the same computer. Some highlights are:

- Normal chess moves of every piece.
- If the king is under attack, only moves that save him are allowed.
- Castling.
- En-passant.
- Promotions.
- End-of-game detection, including draw.

`master` is always deployed [here](https://flo-l.github.io/react-chess).
